# Interesting things to study with 2D analysis
1. Perpetual question: do trends differ if you look at pre-2009 and post-2009 subsets of the data?
	* Do this comparison for every bivariate analysis if possible
	* May also be useful to keep in mind there was a late 2012/early 2013 dip in loans too


12. CSMidpt vs. Loan Status
	* CS vs. BorrowerRate - saw *positive* correlation between these, 
			which is counterintuitive. Let's see what's going on!
4. APR vs. Rate + correlation
 	* IF APR and Rate aren't super-correlated, then do the rest of these for both; otherwise,
 	 focus on Rate
 	* Rate vs. closing date + correlation
 	* Rate vs. loan status
	* LenderYield vs. Rate + correlation: expect this to have r = 1 or nearly so
3. Term vs. Loan Status
3. Listing Date vs. Closed Date and correlation analysis - how related is your start date to your
 end date and how does this change pre-/post-2009?
6. Listing Category vs. Loan Status
11. Employment Status vs. Loan Status (spine plot?)
	* Employment Status vs. Creation Date
13. Delinq vs. LoanStatus
14. MonthlyIncome vs. LoanStatus
15. LoanOrigAmt vs. Loan Status
16. MonthlyPayment vs. Loan Status
