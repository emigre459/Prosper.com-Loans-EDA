# Interesting things to study with 2D analysis
1. Perpetual question: do trends differ if you look at pre-2009 and post-2009 subsets of the data?
	* Do this comparison for every bivariate analysis if possible
	* May also be useful to keep in mind there was a late 2012/early 2013 dip in loans too


12. CS vs. Monthly payment - seeing a positive correlation. Why would your monthly payment be higher 
		for a better credit score? That, barring anything else, would suggest a higher rate...
		* FLAGGED FOR MULTIVARIATE EXPLORATION. Will be good to parse by loan term and/or 
		original loaned amount (perhaps higher CS folks tend to take shorter terms or take out a much
		higher principal, resulting in higher monthly payments?)


	
4. APR vs. Rate + correlation
 	* Monthly Payment vs. Borrower Rate - saw *negative* correlation between these, 
			which is counterintuitive.
		* This is still super confusing, I'll need to try and parse it by a third variable as well.
			Will be useful to do Term and Principal too, but may need more...
 	* Rate vs. loan status
 		* Need to explore this more in Multivariate section. In particular, my "vicious cycle" concern
 			needs to be explored more: if I add in the variable of credit score, do I see the 
 			"high CS = low rates = good loan outcomes" trend I'm expecting?


#Items for re-hashing in analysis section:
1. How did different predictor variables relate to the outcome variable?
	* 

2. How did predictor variables relate to each other?
	* 

3. What was the strongest relationship I observed?
	* Be snarky at first: the ones with r ~ 1 were pretty strong!
	* Then talk about...
